I completed my undergraduate studies at **Zhongnan University of Economics and Law** and earned my Ph.D. from **Renmin University of China**. Currently, I am conducting research at the **Xiangjiang Laboratory**. My primary research focus is on **Graph Neural Network (GNN) algorithms and their applications**, aiming to explore efficient processing and analysis methods for graph-structured data. I am particularly interested in applying these methods to complex system modeling, social network analysis, recommendation systems, and other practical domains. Through continuous research and practice, I strive to advance the development of GNN technologies and provide smarter, more efficient solutions to real-world problems.
